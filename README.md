# Orinoco Ordering System

The Orinoco Ordering System is a simple application with a Text-based UI for Orinoco customers to check their order history, include and exclude items from their baskets, and order items with basket checkout. The application is completely written in Python and it uses an SQLite Database and Pandas for visualisation.
